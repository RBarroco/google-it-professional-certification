When we create a list in Python, we’re creating an object which is an instance of the list class, which represents the concept of a list. Classes also have attributes and methods associated with them. Attributes are the characteristics of the class, while methods are functions that are part of the class."

    "Calling methods on objects executes functions that operate on attributes of a specific instance of the class. This means that calling a method on a list, for example, only modifies that instance of a list, and not all lists globally. We can define methods within a class by creating functions inside the class definition. These instance methods can take a parameter called self which represents the instance the method is being executed on. This will allow you to access attributes of the instance using dot notation, like self.name, which will access the name attribute of that specific instance of the class object. When you have variables that contain different values for different instances, these are called instance variables."

    "You can have a situation where two different classes are related, but there is no inheritance going on. This is referred to as composition -- where one class makes use of code contained in another class. For example, imagine we have a Package class which represents a software package. It contains attributes about the software package, like name, version, and size. We also have a Repository class which represents all the packages available for installation. While there’s no inheritance relationship between the two classes, they are related. The Repository class will contain a dictionary or list of Packages that are contained in the repository. Let's take a look at an example Repository class definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the constructor method, we initialize the packages dictionary, which will contain the package objects available in this repository instance. We initialize the dictionary in the constructor to ensure that every instance of the Repository class has its own dictionary.\n",

This method iterates through the values in our repository dictionary and adds together the size attributes from each package object contained in the dictionary, returning the total at the end. In this example, we’re making use of Package attributes within our Repository class. We’re also calling the values() method on our packages dictionary instance. Composition allows us to use objects as attributes, as well as access all their attributes and methods."
